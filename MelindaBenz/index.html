              My views on nutrition and “healthy eating” have evolved over the years and continue to do so.

              My lifelong interest in nutrition studies combined with an empathic nature has led me down
              the path to become a nutrition counselor. Following our inner wisdom allows you to become
              more attuned to your body's needs . By fostering self-acceptance, determination, and a
              self-loving embrace, long-lasting change can occur. It is my wish to support others in
              making long-lasting changes they always wanted to do, but might have needed a nudge in
              the right direction. I believe our ‘work’ is never done and we are always guided to learn
              new things. This is why I consider myself to be a teacher, yet an avid learner. There are
              many lessons to learn from our real life experiences and the stories we’ve told
              ourselves-whether about our bodies, or what society thinks “health” should look like
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve been vegan since 2015 and was vegetarian for several years prior.
              I love teaching people how easy it is to go vegan, and offering practical solutions to
              the common obstacles we face.
              (Read more here about my story for going vegan-blog link)
              Traditional diet mentality is restrictive and self-limiting. I don’t believe this is how
              life should be! Finding balance is key to living a more health-conscious life and rids you of
              unnecessary guilt and unrealistic expectations.

              Whether you are wanting to go vegan, or simply move your way to eating more healthful whole foods,
              I enjoy showing others how living a plant-centered lifestyle doesn’t have to be complicated or
              time consuming.

            <ul>
              <li>
                I am a total crazy cat lady! If I could have a house full of cats, I totally would!

                It’s my dream to open up a small animal sanctuary. I especially hold cows very dear

              </li>
              <li>
                I’ve taken many intuitive training courses and trained with Hay House, renowned best
                selling author, Sonia Choquette in her ‘Six Sensory’ training program.
              </li>
              <li>
                I received my Reiki Master training in 2016 and plan to continue on to get Karuna Reiki.

              <li>
                I meditate daily-even for a few minutes! I love shopping for new crystals and meditation tools
              </li>
              <li>
                My favorite comfort food is vegan mac n’ cheese or vegan loaded nachos

              <li>
                My favorite form of stress relief is yoga, watching a good TV show, or listening to good dancing music
              </li>

                Watching re-runs of “The Office” is the best medicine! </p>

          The words “health” and “nutrition” has many different meanings in this day and age.
          With a quick google search at our fingertips we can find millions of articles on nutrition.
          It can be quite confusing to know what ‘diet trend’ is real and what’s not.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to think that healthy living doesn’t have to be complicated nor does it have one standard definition.
          In fact, every body is different! I offer clients a multifaceted and individualized view on how to develop
          an awareness of the foods and eating patterns that align with what your specific body needs, while actually
          enjoying your eating experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many people, especially those who jump from diet to diet, this is a foreign concept since we’ve been
          trained to “eat this” “not that” and often associate healthy eating as time consuming and boring.

            Health has many different meanings. It’s up to you to decide what that means for you. I believe the key 
            to lifelong health and wellness is to listen to our bodies internal wisdom. With the right tools, you 
            have everything you need to make informed decisions about what you choose to put on your plates.

            your personal medical history and health and wellness vision.
