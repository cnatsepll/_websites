                    The words “health” and “nutrition” has many different meanings in this day and age.
                    With a quick google search at our fingertips we can find millions of articles on nutrition.
                    It can be quite confusing to know what ‘diet trend’ is real and what’s not.
                    </p>

                    I like to think that healthy living doesn’t have to be complicated nor does it have one standard definition.
                    In fact, every body is different! I offer clients a multifaceted and individualized view on how to develop
                    an awareness of the foods and eating patterns that align with what your specific body needs, while actually
                    enjoying your eating experience.

                    <p>
                    For many people, especially those who jump from diet to diet, this is a foreign concept since we’ve been
                    trained to “eat this” “not that” and often associate healthy eating as time consuming and boring.

                        Health has many different meanings. It’s up to you to decide what that means for you. I believe the key 
                        to lifelong health and wellness is to listen to our bodies internal wisdom. With the right tools, you 
                        have everything you need to make informed decisions about what you choose to put on your plates.
