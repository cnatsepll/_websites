                  Registered Dietitian, Nutritionist, Reiki Master, and ethical vegan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My views on nutrition and “healthy eating” have evolved over the years and continue to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My lifelong interest in nutrition studies combined with an empathic nature has led me down
                  the path to become a nutrition counselor. Following our inner wisdom allows you to become
                  more attuned to your body's needs . By fostering self-acceptance, determination, and a
                  self-loving embrace, long-lasting change can occur. It is my wish to support others in
                  making long-lasting changes they always wanted to do, but might have needed a nudge in
                  the right direction. We tell ourselves false stories about our bodies and what 
                  society thinks “health” should look like. 
                </p>

                  I’ve been vegan since 2015 and was vegetarian for several years prior.
                  I love teaching people how easy it is to go vegan, and offering practical solutions to
                  the common obstacles we face.
                  (Read more here about my story for going vegan-blog link)
                  Traditional diet mentality is restrictive and self-limiting. I believe finding balance 
                  is key to living a more health-conscious life, and learning to filter through the 
                  guilt-ridden, unrealistic expectations of society.

                    It’s my dream to open up a small animal sanctuary. I especially hold cows very dear

                    Whether you are wanting to go vegan, or simply move your way to eating more healthful whole foods,
                    I enjoy showing others how living a plant-centered lifestyle doesn’t have to be complicated or
                    time consuming.
