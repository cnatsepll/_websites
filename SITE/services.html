                            Have you heard the term “mindful eating” or “intuitive eating”, but aren’t sure how this concept might apply in your life? 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Are you struggling with your relationship with your body and food?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Have you tried every diet on the planet only to be discouraged? 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Are you ready to think less about food and eating, yet feel more connected to your eating experiences more than ever before?

                        What if it were as simple as listening to your body when it says its had enough food to eat. For many of us we’ve learned to 
                        “turn off” our hunger/fullness signals, only to ignore this important biological component which informs us when we’ve had 
                        enough nourishment from food. During one-on-one mindful eating coaching, you will learn the fundamental basics of mindful 
                        eating concepts and gain lifelong mindful eating tools to incorporate into your daily life. You will get customized hands-on 
                        mindful eating practices specific to your eating habits, mindful eating meditation experiences, and one-on-one nutrition coaching 
                        support. Most importantly you will have an opportunity to make peace with food and discover a deeper appreciation for the mind 
                        body connection.

                    </ul>
                        Join us to find out for yourself what it means to be a ‘connected vegan’. In this group class you will get an abundance of vegan 
                        nutrition education plus group connection and support. As a group you will have an opportunity to learn from others and share your own 
                        stories throughout the weeks. You will learn the fundamental basics of vegan nutrition + lifestyle. Cooking demos, grocery store tour, 
                        and recipes will be provided to help get you more comfortable with cooking vegan cuisine. We will discuss simple ingredient swaps when 
                        making any recipe vegan-friendly. Debunk common vegan nutrition myths and go over nutrient considerations. Tips for navigating social 
                        gatherings and dining out at restaurants. Discuss sneaky non-vegan ingredients commonly found in food products, and how to quickly scan 
                        a Nutrition Facts ingredient label to determine if the product is vegan. By the end of this course, you will gain a solid understanding 
                        of vegan living and have a toolkit readily available. You will have the opportunity to develop an ongoing connected vegan support group
                         with a class Facebook group page. We will also have a vegan potluck dinner celebration as a group on the last week of class!
