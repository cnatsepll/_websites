                      My views on nutrition and “healthy eating” have evolved over the years and continue to do so.

                      My lifelong interest in nutrition studies combined with an empathic nature has led me down 
                      the path to become a nutrition counselor. Following our inner wisdom allows you to become 
                      more attuned to your body's needs . By fostering self-acceptance, determination, and a 
                      self-loving embrace, long-lasting change can occur. It is my wish to support others in 
                      making long-lasting changes they always wanted to do, but might have needed a nudge in 
                      the right direction. I believe our ‘work’ is never done and we are always guided to learn
                       new things. This is why I consider myself to be a teacher, yet an avid learner. There are
                        many lessons to learn from our real life experiences and the stories we’ve told 
                        ourselves-whether about our bodies, or what society thinks “health” should look like
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I’ve been vegan since 2015 and was vegetarian for several years prior. 
                      I love teaching people how easy it is to go vegan, and offering practical solutions to
                       the common obstacles we face.  
                      (Read more here about my story for going vegan-blog link)
                      Traditional diet mentality is restrictive and self-limiting. I don’t believe this is how 
                      life should be! Finding balance is key to living a more health-conscious life and rids you of 
                      unnecessary guilt and unrealistic expectations.

                    Whether you are wanting to go vegan, or simply move your way to eating more healthful whole foods,
                    I enjoy showing others how living a plant-centered lifestyle doesn’t have to be complicated or
                    time consuming.

                  Some fun facts about me:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                        I am a total crazy cat lady! If I could have a house full of cats, I totally would! 
                        For now, I’ll stick to two.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It’s my dream to open up a small animal sanctuary. I especially hold cows very dear 
                        to my heart-they are so stinkin’ cute! 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I’ve taken many intuitive training courses and trained with Hay House, renowned best 
                        selling author, Sonia Choquette in her ‘Six Sensory’ training program.
                    </li>                
                    <li>
                        I received my Reiki Master training in 2016 and plan to continue on to get Karuna Reiki.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I meditate daily-even for a few minutes! I love shopping for new crystals and meditation tools
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My favorite comfort food is vegan mac n’ cheese or vegan loaded nachos
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My favorite form of stress relief is yoga, watching a good TV show, or listening to good dancing music
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Watching re-runs of “The Office” is the best medicine!                             </p>

                The words “health” and “nutrition” has many different meanings in this day and age. 
                With a quick google search at our fingertips we can find millions of articles on nutrition. 
                It can be quite confusing to know what ‘diet trend’ is real and what’s not.

                I like to think that healthy living doesn’t have to be complicated nor does it have one standard definition. 
                In fact, every body is different! I offer clients a multifaceted and individualized view on how to develop 
                an awareness of the foods and eating patterns that align with what your specific body needs, while actually 
                enjoying your eating experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                For many people, especially those who jump from diet to diet, this is a foreign concept since we’ve been 
                trained to “eat this” “not that” and often associate healthy eating as time consuming and boring.
